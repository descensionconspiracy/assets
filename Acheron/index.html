                    the names she is now called. She is but a wanderer without origin and name, traversing the cosmos
                    with nothing but her
                    blade in hand.

                    Though aloof and taciturn, her blade flicks out like lashing lightning. And yet, she always strikes
                    with her scabbard, never drawing the sword free.

                        THEMSELVES.</span>
                    In her travels, she has faced and witnessed countless setbacks, and many more tragedies; the glory
                    and disgrace of several planets and civilizations. <br><br>But <span class="acolor">ACHERON</span>
                    is no
                    hero: she does not actively seek to interfere in the matters
                    she comes upon—rather dealing with them carrying a stark <i>indifference</i>, as is the way of
                    <span class="meicolor more-info" data-info="Nihility here refers to the Aeon of Nihility—
                    that is, the primordial outer god governing the concept of non-existence."><b>NIHILITY</b></span>. Selfish in her conduct, she will only act when a matter holds particular
                    significance to her—preferring, instead, to subtly inspire and encourage those around her to seek
                    salvation through their own means.

                    she is and will always be
                    <b>ALONE.</b> She does not resent the
                    cards fate has dealt to her, nor does she wail in lamentation, for it is precisely her inability to
                    return, to retrace her own steps, that allows her to wander forward without <b>fear</b>, towards
                    that primordial light under the veil of <b>NIHILITY...</b>

                    from what's been implied or stated in canon, for purposes of combat roleplay; and even then, I don't
                    plan on having her unsheathe her sword under any circumstances.">Disclaimer</span>.<br><br>

                    <span class="title">FIGHTING STYLE.</span>
                    <span class="acolor">ACHERON</span> is well-versed both in swordplay and martial arts—preferring
                    <i>practicality</i> over power. Her fighting style and strategies are more suited for disarming and
                    neutralizing opponents, rather than outright killing them; this is simply because she finds it more
                    convenient not to be in the spotlight, though some have attributed it due to a kinder nature within
                    the Emanator.<br><br>

                    <span class="title">EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION AND INTERACTION.</span>
                    <span class="acolor">ACHERON</span> is capable of doing the impossible and <span class="more-info"

                    <span class="title">IMMORTALITY.</span>
                    Being a <span class="acolor">Self-Annihilator</span>, the concept of "aging" holds no ability over
                    her; and death does not come easy, as well, being capable of reattaching limbs naturally if they are
                    severed,
                    though not without cost to her present stamina, nor is it instantaneous.<br><br>

                    <span class="title">LIGHTNING & ENERGY SOVEREIGNTY.</span>
                    Owing to her previous experiences commanding <span class="acolor">Lightning</span> through the third
                    Edict Edge, <span class="title">ACHERON</span> has the ability to control Electricity and project
                    energy, particularly through her slashes—well, scabbard strikes. This extends itself to
                    electromagnetic field manipulation, but only if a certain focus is given to it—she hasn't felt the
                    need to practice this particular ability as of late.<br><br>

                    <span class="title more-info"
                        data-info="Also known as: why she'll never unsheathe her sword, ever.">NIHILITY.</span>
                    Among the Emanators, the <span class="acolor">Emanator of Nihility</span> is an unique existence. As
                    its Aeon, by default, does not care about anything, for it is <b>NIHILITY</b>, she is capable of
                    invoking its power almost endlessly <span class="meicolor">when she draws her sword.</span> In
                    this state, Acheron's hair becomes completely white, and crimson tattoos run over her flesh.<br><br>

                    With this ability, the Emanator can bring time to a standstill, cut through space, real or
                    imaginary—such as dreams—and bring anything and anybody affected by her blade to the Horizon of
                    Existence, where she can choose to wield <b>NIHILITY</b> to completely erase the fact of their
                    existence, effectively making it so they never existed at all.<br><br>

                    This condition affects her negatively; consumed by <b>NIHILITY</b> as she is, her past <i>does not
                        exist</i>, in the sense that it was erased from space-time: it is as if she simply 'appeared in
                    the universe' one day,
                    though she can recall such erased memories when drawing upon her blade.
