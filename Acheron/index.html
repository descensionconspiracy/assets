                        ACHERON...</span> those are
                    the names she is now called. She is but a wanderer without origin and name, traversing the cosmos
                    with nothing but her
                    blade in hand.

                    Though aloof and taciturn, her blade flicks out like lashing lightning. And yet, she always strikes
                    with her scabbard, never drawing the sword free.

                        THEMSELVES.</span>
                    In her travels, she has faced and witnessed countless setbacks, and many more tragedies; the glory
                    and disgrace of several planets and civilizations. <br><br>But <span class="acolor">ACHERON</span> is no
                    hero: she does not actively seek to interfere in the matters
                    she comes upon—rather dealing with them carrying a stark <i>indifference</i>, as is the way of
                    <b>NIHILITY.</b> Selfish in her conduct, she will only act when a matter holds particular
                    significance to her—preferring, instead, to subtly inspire and encourage those around her to seek
                    salvation through their own means.

                        class="acolor">ACHERON</span> knows she has nowhere to come back to: though the past forges who
                    we
                    are, it is but a fleeting thing—as with everything, it too must cease to be.<br><br> Occasionally, she comes
                    across one with whom she may share her travels—in the appreciation of the journey—but, in the end,
                    she is and will always be
                    <b>ALONE.</b> She does not resent the
                    cards fate has dealt to her, nor does she wail in lamentation, for it is precisely her inability to
                    return, to retrace her own steps, that allows her to wander forward without <b>fear</b>, towards
                    that primordial light under the veil of <b>NIHILITY...</b>
